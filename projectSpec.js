Student Name : Felix Akinloye
Name of Project : Flexzy Weather App

Idea of the project : Is to create a weather application that also has google map on it.
         when the city name of our choice is being searched on the search icon, the web page should return the city's felt temperature/humidity/wind/
       visibility/max.temperature/min.temperature for the exact city name searched.
      it should also show the weather forecast of the exact day searched and for the next 7days.
